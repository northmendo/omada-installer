# Omada Installer
A script to perform a new install of the TP-Link Omada SDN Controller software on Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 or 20.04.

Please see link below for instructions on upgrading from 3.2.14 or below.
For upgrading from 4.1.4 or later, you _should_ be able to download the latest version and upgrade using dpkg.
However, perform at your own risk and **be sure to take a backup!**
